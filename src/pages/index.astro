        <h2>Andreas Ekvall-Hofvander</h2>
        <p>Copenhagen-based Swede coding up a storm in Denmark, always eager to learn and seeking opportuinities to apply my skills. On the lookout for an internship to further fuel my passion for web development.</p>    
        <p>In 2023 I embarked on a new journey to change my future. I put down my pots and pans; left the kitchen and switched it all out for keyboards, screens and (sometimes) comfy office-chairs at KEA, studying Multimediadesign.</p>
        <p>Always expanding my Front-end skills by making things; currently diving into Astro and later on during the semester there will be React added to the toolbox.</p>    
        <p>My leisure-time is spent mostly in front of the screen figuring out things and learning, but sometimes there is time for the occasional game or two. If Iâ€™m not inside I prefer being outside having a good walk or practicing my flips with my skateboard. Or just being in the backyard grilling up my latest craving.</p>
